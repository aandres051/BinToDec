This litle project change from binary number to decimal number.

A binary number is a number expressed in **the base-2 numeral system**, which uses only two symbols: "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

Any number can be represented by a sequence of bits (binary digits). Usually this numerals are read digit-by-digit. 
#### For Example
The number 101 it's **_one zero one_** not *One hundred one*.

## ¿How is it counted in binary numbers?
In the binary system, each digit represents an increasing power of 2, with the rightmost digit representing 2 power of 0, the next representing 2 power of 1, then 2 power of 2, and so on. The value of a binary number is the sum of the powers of 2 represented by each "1" digit.
